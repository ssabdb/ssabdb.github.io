Intestinal failure
: The failure of the intestine to meet nutritional equirements secondary to inadequate length or function, resulting in dependency on IV nutrition.

Short Gut Syndrome
: Malabsorption caused by lack of functional small intestine

# The GI Tract

So it turns out the intestines are actually pretty important. 

The intestines are a very long tube shaped structure and make up the majority of the GI tract, which runs from the mouth right down to the anus. They are generally split into to two sections – the large intestine (colon) and the small intestine. Combined they have many functions, but primarily they serve to absorb nutrients, fluid and all sorts of goodness from the food and drink we eat. In short – they give us energy to survive!

The intestines can be split into various parts that all do different things

## Small Intestines

Duodenum
: The first and shortest part. It receives undigested food from the stomach and begins the process of breaking it down with enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver. It also absorbs a small amount of nutrients.

Jejunum
: The second part. The majority of nutrients are absorbed here and enter the blood stream to fuel the rest of the body.

Ileum
: The final part of the small intestine. This absorbs any nutrients that weren’t absorbed earlier on, in particular B12 and bile acids.

## Large Intestines

Also known as the colon, the Large intestines serve to absorb water and importantly help maintain fluid balance.

This is important to know as when certain parts don’t work properly, you can predict what problems might occur.

Sometimes the intestines are shorter than normal or don’t function correctly. This is called short gut syndrome and can affect all age groups. There are many reasons this can occur:

* **Short Length**: Surgical removal secondary to diseases or trauma
* **Poor Function**: Malabsorption, …

When this happens the body is left with no way to absorb nutrients, salts and fluids and can give rise to symptoms such as diarrhoea, fatigue, weakness, bloating and cramping. Ultimately this can result in dehydration and malnourishment. In severe cases this can be life threatening.
